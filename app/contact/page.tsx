​Is JSON Lab really free?

Yes! JSON Lab is a passion project by Aziz Ur Rehman Niazi. It is completely free to use with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or premium features locked behind paywalls.

​Do you store my data?

Absolutely not. Privacy is our core pillar. All processing happens locally in your browser. We never see, store, or transmit your JSON data to any server. You can verify this by checking your network traffic or reading our Privacy Policy.
