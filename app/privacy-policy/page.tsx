Privacy Policy
​Last Updated: January 3, 2026

​TL;DR
​Your JSON data never leaves your device. JSON Lab runs 100% in your browser. We have no servers and no access to your data. To keep this tool free, we use Google AdSense, which uses cookies to show relevant ads.

​1. No Data Collection (JSON Content)
​JSON Lab is a strictly client-side application. All JSON processing, formatting, validation, and visualization happens entirely within your web browser.

​Zero Uploads: Your JSON data is never uploaded to any server.
​No Backend: We have no database or backend servers that receive your content.
​No Access: We cannot see, access, or retrieve any text you paste into the editor.
​No Accounts: No user registration or authentication is required.
​2. Cookies and Advertising (AdSense Requirement)
​To provide this service for free, we use Google AdSense to serve advertisements.

​Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this website or other websites.
​Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to JSON Lab and/or other sites on the Internet.
​You may opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings.
​3. Local Storage Usage
​JSON Lab uses your browser's local storage (IndexedDB) solely to enhance your experience:

​Auto-save: To keep your current editing session if you refresh the page.
​Preferences: To remember your chosen theme (Dark/Light) and editor settings. This data stays on your machine. You can clear it anytime through your browser's settings.
​4. Log Files
​Like most websites, we collect non-identifiable information that browsers make available, such as IP addresses, browser type, and referring pages. This is used solely to analyze site traffic and ensure technical stability.

​5. Verify It Yourself
​We believe in transparency. You can verify our privacy claims at any time:

​Network Tab: Open your browser’s Developer Tools (F12) and check the "Network" tab—no external requests are made when you process your JSON.
​Offline Mode: The app works completely offline after the initial load.
​Local Only: Unplug your internet and use the tool; it will function perfectly because nothing is sent to a server.
​6. Contact Information

​Why this version is better for you:
​AdSense Compliance: It includes the specific "Third-party vendors" and "Ads Settings" link clauses that Google's bots look for during the review process.
​Protects Your Reputation: It clarifies that while the JSON is private, the website uses standard ad-tracking. This prevents you from being accused of "false claims" by Google.
​Maintains Your Value: It keeps your "Verify it yourself" section, which is a great "pro-user" feature.
