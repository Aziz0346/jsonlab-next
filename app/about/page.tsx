About JSON Lab
​Our Mission
​At JSON Lab, we believe that data handling should be seamless, secure, and accessible to everyone. Our mission is to provide developers, data analysts, and students with a robust, privacy-first environment to format, validate, and visualize JSON data without the risk of sensitive information leaving their local machine.

​The Founder
​JSON Lab was founded and developed by Aziz Ur Rehman Niazi, an educator and entrepreneur based in Pakistan.

​With a background in education and a passion for building utility-driven technology, Aziz created this platform to solve a common problem: the need for professional-grade developer tools that do not compromise user privacy. As an educator, his goal is to make technical processes easier to understand and execute for the global developer community.

​Why JSON Lab?
​Most online formatters upload your data to a server for processing. We took a different approach. JSON Lab is built as a 100% Client-Side tool. This means:

​Total Privacy: Your data never touches our servers. All processing happens right in your browser.
​Offline Capability: Once the site is loaded, you can continue to format and validate your files even without an internet connection.
​High Performance: By utilizing local system resources, we provide instant results without the latency of server-side requests.
​What We Offer
​We have designed our workspace to be more than just a simple formatter. JSON Lab provides a comprehensive suite of features:

​Smart Editor: A powerful code editor with syntax highlighting and error detection.
​Schema Validation: Ensure your JSON structures comply with industry standards.
​Tree View Visualization: Navigate complex, nested data structures with a clean, hierarchical interface.
​Diff Compare: Easily spot differences between two JSON objects.
